The main purpose of Content Manager is to help you maintain focus and productivity by organizing your browsing sessions into logical groups. For example:

- **Work Context**: All the tabs you need for your job (email, project management, documentation)
- **Development Context**: Your coding environment, GitHub, Stack Overflow, and other developer tools
- **Personal Context**: Social media, news sites, and personal projects
- **Study Context**: Educational resources, research papers, and learning platforms

ðŸ‘‰[Chrome web store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/content-manager/lobbohngjkkghmganebnahlfajlahkic) or

### Technical Details
Content Manager consists of:

- A Chrome extension frontend built with **Vite** and **React TypeScript**
- A local server with back-end implementation inside of Vite
- A **IndexedDB** local database

### TODO
- [ ] Add a settings option that opens a web page for better context management, more settings, and customization (e.g., deleting selected pages from a context)
- [ ] Set up a server to allow user synchronization between devices OR add encryption/database conversion to generate a sync code
