# Context Manager Chrome Extension

Context Manager is a powerful Chrome extension that helps you organize and manage your browsing sessions by creating and switching between different contexts. Each context represents a group of related web pages that you frequently access together.

## Purpose

The main purpose of Context Manager is to help you maintain focus and productivity by organizing your browsing sessions into logical groups. For example:

- **Work Context**: All the tabs you need for your job (email, project management, documentation)
- **Development Context**: Your coding environment, GitHub, Stack Overflow, and other developer tools
- **Personal Context**: Social media, news sites, and personal projects
- **Study Context**: Educational resources, research papers, and learning platforms

## How It Works

1. **Create Contexts**: Define different contexts with custom names and icons
2. **Add Pages**: Add your frequently visited pages to each context
3. **Switch Contexts**: With a single click, switch between contexts:
   - The extension will close your current tabs
   - Open all the pages associated with your selected context
   - You can instantly shift your focus from work to study, or from personal to development

## Features

- **Context Management**: Create, edit, and delete contexts
- **Page Organization**: Group related pages into contexts
- **Quick Switching**: Instantly switch between different browsing environments
- **Custom Icons**: Assign custom icons to each context for easy identification
- **Persistence**: Your contexts and pages are saved between browser sessions

## Use Cases

- **Work-Life Balance**: Keep your work and personal browsing separate
- **Project Management**: Create contexts for different projects
- **Learning**: Organize educational resources by subject or course
- **Research**: Group research materials by topic
- **Development**: Switch between different development environments
