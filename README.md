# Content Manager Chrome Extension

[Content Manager](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/content-manager/lobbohngjkkghmganebnahlfajlahkic) is a powerful Chrome extension that helps you organize and manage your browsing sessions by creating and switching between different contexts. Each context represents a group of related web pages that you frequently access together.

## üéØ Purpose

The main purpose of Content Manager is to help you maintain focus and productivity by organizing your browsing sessions into logical groups. For example:

- **Work Context**: All the tabs you need for your job (email, project management, documentation)
- **Development Context**: Your coding environment, GitHub, Stack Overflow, and other developer tools
- **Personal Context**: Social media, news sites, and personal projects
- **Study Context**: Educational resources, research papers, and learning platforms

## üöÄ Install the Extension

You can install it on the [Chrome web store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/content-manager/lobbohngjkkghmganebnahlfajlahkic)

OR you can manually download the latest ready-to-use version here:
